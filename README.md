## Introduction

This project is an analysis and visualization of my chess games played on Chess.com. 
The goal is to gain insights into various aspects of the games, including player performance, popular openings and game outcomes. 
The project involves data collection, parsing, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Goals

The main goals of this project include:

1. Collecting a large dataset of my chess games played on Chess.com.
2. Parsing the PGN (Portable Game Notation) data to extract game details and moves.
3. Analyzing my performance, including win rates and rating changes.
4. Visualizing the data to present insights through plots and charts.
5. Drawing conclusions about preferred openings and game outcomes.

## Data Collection

The data for this project was collected from my Chess.com game archive in a PGN (Portable Game Notation) format.

## Data Parsing

The collected data was parsed using Python scripts to extract relevant information, including game details (Event, Site, Date, Players, Result, etc.) and the sequence of moves.

## Data Analysis

The parsed data was analyzed to calculate statistics, such as win rates and rating changes. Additionally, the data was used to identify popular openings and their game outcomes.

## Data Visualization

The project includes various data visualization techniques, such as pie charts and bar graphs to present the findings in a visually appealing and informative manner.

## Results

- The results of the analysis and visualization are available in the project's Jupyter Notebook or report.
- Some key findings include my most successful openings as black and white, which day of the week I have the highest win rate, my ELO rating over time, etc.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements for this project may include:

- Real-time data updates using the Chess.com API.
- Additional statistical analysis and machine learning to predict game outcomes.
- Enhanced interactive visualizations for exploring individual games.
- Integration with a web application for greater accessibility.
